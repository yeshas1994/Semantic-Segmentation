# Semantic Segmentation

This repository contains code for several deep learning models for semantic segmentation. 

Currently implemented in PyTorch are:
 - Deeplab v3 + (Mobilenetv2_OS8 backbone only)
 - FCN (all pretrained resnet backbones from pytorch)
 - UNet 

Currently the only compatible dataset is Cityscapes.

## Instructions
#### Train Model:
```
python train_model.py 

```

## Requirements

 ## TODOS 
 - Add Transfer Learning/Fine-tuning
 - Add more datasets (ADE20K/COCO) 
 - Add colab notebooks
